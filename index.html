                        Pat Corcoran is a new coding student enrolled in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. He has plenty to learn about web design, website creation, and the coding languages that manipulate websites. He is excited to dipping his toes into this subject material and can't wait until he starts to feel capable and effective in this field. He is aware that it may take awhile, but that won't deter him.

                        Up until now, Pat has been working in the communications and marketing field. He's focused on the political and non-for-profit world and has seen and experienced both success and frustration. Political work can be very exilerating when elections go the way of your prefered candidate. This has lead Pat to working in the Office of the Governor of Illinois and working on projects that included the implimentation of the Affordable Care Act in Illinois. However, the downside of political work is that when your candidate does not win, you can be left working in unideal situations between election cycles. This frustration is what brough Pat to coding. A new field with less trecherous career opportunities and the ability to work on projects that will exist no matter whom is in office.

                        Coding will open up new opportunities to Pat and will allow him to have a transportable skill base that can travel with him to new opportunities in different cities. It will also allow Pat to work independently and travel more. These are things that his previous career did not allow and will be a welcome change to Pat's life.
